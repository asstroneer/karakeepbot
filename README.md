## Installation

### Docker

#### Using `docker run`

Use the `docker run` command to start `Karakeepbot`. Make sure to set the required environment variables:

```sh
docker run --name karakeepbot \
  -e KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token \
  -e KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_ALLOWLIST=your-telegram-chat-id \
  -e KARAKEEPBOT_KARAKEEP_TOKEN=your-karakeep-api-key \
  -e KARAKEEPBOT_KARAKEEP_URL=https://your-karakeep-instance.tld \
  ghcr.io/madh93/karakeepbot:latest
```

#### Using `docker compose`

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
services:
  karakeepbot:
    image: ghcr.io/madh93/karakeepbot:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    # volumes:
    #   - ./custom.config.toml:/var/run/ko/config.default.toml # Optional: specify a custom configuration file instead of the default one
    environment:
      - KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token

      - KARAKEEPBOT_KARAKEEP_TOKEN=your-karakeep-api-key
      - KARAKEEPBOT_KARAKEEP_URL=https://your-karakeep-instance.tld
```

Use the `docker compose up` command to start `Karakeepbot`:

```sh
docker compose up
```

### From releases

Download the latest binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/Madh93/karakeepbot/releases):

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/Madh93/karakeepbot/releases/latest/download/karakeepbot_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar -xz -O karakeepbot > /usr/local/bin/karakeepbot
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/karakeepbot
```

### From source

If you have Go installed:

```sh
go install github.com/Madh93/karakeepbot@latest
```

## Configuration

`Karakeepbot` comes with a [default configuration file](config.default.toml) that you can modify to suit your needs.

### Loading a custom configuration file

You can load a different configuration file by using the `-config path/to/config/file` flag when starting the application:

```sh
karakeepbot -config custom.config.toml
```

### Overriding with environment variables

Additionally, you can override the configuration values using environment variables that begin with the prefix `KARAKEEPBOT_`. This allows you to customize your setup without needing to modify any configuration file:

```sh
KARAKEEPBOT_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_ALLOWLIST=chat_id_1,chat_id_2 karakeepbot
```

#### Telegram Webhook Mode

To run the bot in webhook mode instead of long polling, configure the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_MODE` | Bot mode: `webhook` or `long_polling` | `webhook` |
| `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` | External URL where Telegram will send webhooks | `https://bot.example.com` |
| `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PATH` | Path suffix for the webhook endpoint (default: `/telegram-webhook`) | `/telegram-webhook` |
| `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` | Secret token for webhook validation | `my-secret-token` |
| `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_LISTEN_ADDR` | Internal address for the HTTP server | `:8080` |

### Security Concerns

To protect your bot from abuse and spam from unauthorized users, `Karakeepbot` implements a **mandatory Chat ID allowlist**.

By default, the bot is configured with a placeholder value and **it will not start** until you explicitly configure the `telegram.allowlist` parameter. You have two options:

1. **Recommended:** Provide a list of one or more specific Chat IDs. This ensures only you and other authorized users can interact with the bot.
2. **Not Recommended:** Provide an empty list (`[]` or `KARAKEEPBOT_TELEGRAM_ALLOWLIST=""` environment variable). This will allow any Telegram user to interact with your bot, exposing it to potential abuse.

#### How to Find Your Chat ID

1. Open your Telegram client.
2. Search for the bot `@userinfobot` and start a chat with it.
3. The bot will immediately reply with your user information, including your **Id**. This is your Chat ID.
